This is my portfolio.

I created this to display my work and give potential clients a way to contact me and view more about me.

I started out with a bootstrap theme but changed it drastically to make it work with what I wanted.

I have it separated out into 3 different pages, Index, Portfolio and Contact. Each page has a header with a menu to navigate between the pages and a footer with links to my GitHub, LinkedIn and Facebook.

In my Index page I give a description of myself along with a picture of me and a link to my resume.

In my contact page I have a way for anyone interested in reaching out to me, getting in contact with me.

In my portfolio page I have links to some of my work with the titles of each one beign a link to the repository.
